[00:00.00] 
[00:05.00] Beneath the sun, the golden haze,
[00:10.00] Waves whisper soft, they dance, they play.
[00:15.00] A dog’s laugh echoes through the sand,
[00:21.00] Joyful chaos we can’t command.
[00:26.00] Drifting clouds paint the open skies,
[00:29.00] Salt and laughter in our eyes.
[00:31.00] Time dissolves like footprints fade,
[00:34.00] Here forever, where dreams are made.
[00:36.00] Oh, the ocean sings in harmony,
[00:39.00] With the breeze and you, and the boundless sea.
[00:42.00] We’re alive, we’re free, on these summer shores,
[00:45.00] With a dog’s small bark, and the sun’s encore.
[00:58.00] Shells are secrets, the tide confides,
[01:04.00] Each a treasure the sea provides.
[01:08.00] The pup runs wild, chasing waves,
[01:13.00] A dance of life, so bold, so brave.
[01:18.00] We’re weightless here in endless hues,
[01:23.00] Amber mornings and sunset blues.
[01:29.00] Every moment a melody,
[01:33.00] Woven from sunlight and salty seas.
[01:39.00] Oh, the ocean sings in harmony,
[01:41.00] With the breeze and you, and the boundless sea.
[01:44.00] We’re alive, we’re free, on these summer shores,
[01:48.00] With a dog’s small bark, and the sun’s encore.
[01:45.00] On your path to dreams, don’t you forget,
[01:50.00] Oh, the ocean sings in harmony,
[01:52.00] With the breeze and you, and the boundless sea.
[01:55.00] We’re alive, we’re free, on these summer shores,
[01:58.00] With a dog’s small bark, and the sun’s encore.
[02:12.00] Golden shores, where the world stands still,
[02:14.00] Echoes linger, hearts to fill.
[02:16.00] A summer symphony we’ll replay,
[02:19.00] Under the sun, forever stay.
